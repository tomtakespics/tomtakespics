<p>Wow, I've not posted on here for a while!</p>

<p>Recently, I went to London for 4 days, and I saw all the sights. Some days I was up high in the sky, some days I was far down underground.</p>

<p>On the 1st day, I went to a Bella Italia (an Italian restaurant), which was very nice. I have gone to ones closer to me before, so I knew the usual experience. After that, I went to an art gallery called Frameless. It was basically a few massive underground rooms filled with projectors that played video-ised versions of popular paintings.</p>

<p>On the 2nd day, I went to St. Paul's cathedral and the Sky Garden, which were both very tall buildings! I liked the cathedral and the Sky Garden was like a Center Parcs' swimming pool if there wasn't a pool and there was restaurants instead.</p>

<p>Now I don't have any photos of the next day, but I went to the Science Museum, which was pretty interesting and tried UberEats for the first time (not bad, a little room-temperature-y), so that was cool too!</p>

<p>On the 4th day, I didn't do anything except go back home after a long holiday - well it felt long, although it was only 3 days! Overall, London was nice, and although I've been there before, there's always more to do and see there every time.</p>

<p>Not all of these photos are on Unsplash becuase of:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Copyright</strong>, due to paintings (I don't want to break the law).</li>

<li><strong>Low quality</strong>, due to low lighting or cramped spaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, all of the nice ones are on there right now.</p>

<p>Well, see you in another 5 months when I post on here again!</p>
